# Main Rotor Movements and Helicopter Forces

## Up
- **Rotor Movement**: All blades are at the same pitch.
- **Force/Direction**: The helicopter ascends.

## Forward
- **Rotor Movement**: The rotor tilts forward.
- **Blade Pitch**: Blades get more pitch on the way toward the tail.
- **Force/Direction**: The helicopter moves forward.

## Backward
- **Rotor Movement**: The rotor tilts backward.
- **Blade Pitch**: Blades get more pitch on the way toward the nose.
- **Force/Direction**: The helicopter moves backward.

## Sideways
- **Rotor Movement**: The rotor tilts toward the direction of travel.
- **Blade Pitch**: Blades get more pitch on the way toward the side opposite the direction of travel.
- **Force/Direction**: The helicopter moves sideways.

## Hover
- **Rotor Movement**: All blades are at the same pitch.
- **Force/Direction**: The helicopter hovers in place.

## Turn
- **Rotor Movement**: The helicopter hovers.
- **Tail Rotor**: The pitch of the tail rotor blades swings the craft.
- **Force/Direction**: The helicopter rotates or turns on its vertical axis.

## Down and Autorotation
- **Rotor Movement**: All blades are at a low pitch.
- **Force/Direction**: The helicopter descends or autorotates (gliding down without engine power).

# Controls
- **Collective Pitch Stick**: Used to change the pitch of all rotor blades collectively, which controls the vertical movement (up or down).
- **Cyclic Pitch Stick**: Used to tilt the rotor disc in the desired direction, which controls horizontal movement (forward, backward, sideways).

# Four Forces Acting on a Helicopter

## 1. Lift
- **Description**: The upward force generated by the rotor blades as they spin.
- **Cause**: Created by the airfoil shape of the rotor blades and the angle of attack.
- **Effect**: Opposes weight and allows the helicopter to ascend or hover.

## 2. Weight (Gravity)
- **Description**: The downward force due to gravity acting on the helicopter's mass.
- **Cause**: The mass of the helicopter and the acceleration due to gravity.
- **Effect**: Opposes lift and pulls the helicopter toward the ground.

## 3. Thrust
- **Description**: The forward force generated by the rotor blades when tilted.
- **Cause**: The engine power and the pitch of the rotor blades.
- **Effect**: Moves the helicopter forward or in any direction of tilt.

## 4. Drag
- **Description**: The resistance force that opposes the helicopter's movement through the air.
- **Cause**: Air resistance and the helicopter's aerodynamic profile.
- **Effect**: Opposes thrust and slows the helicopter down.
