**Introduction**
- A helicopter is an aircraft lifted and propelled by horizontal rotors.
- The term "helicopter" comes from the French "hélicoptère" and Greek words "helix" (spiral) and "pteron" (wing).
- Helicopters are distinct from fixed-wing aircraft due to their ability to hover and take off/land vertically.

**Historical Development**
- Early helicopters were built during the first half-century of flight.
- In 1942, Igor Sikorsky's design reached full-scale production.
- The turbine age began in 1951 with Charles H. Kaman’s K-225 helicopter, leading to more powerful and efficient helicopters.

**Advantages of Turbine Engines**
- Less vibration
- Increased performance
- Reliability
- Ease of operation

**Uses of Helicopters**
- Transportation
- Construction
- Firefighting
- Search and rescue

**Rotor System**
- The rotor system consists of a mast, hub, and rotor blades.
- Different rotor configurations include single main rotor, tandem rotors, coaxial rotors, and intermeshing rotors.
- Antitorque controls like tail rotors, Fenestron, and NOTAR are used to manage torque effects.

**Primary Flight Controls**
1. **Cyclic**: Controls direction by tilting the rotor disk.
2. **Collective**: Changes the pitch of all rotor blades equally to adjust altitude.
3. **Antitorque Pedals**: Controls the direction of the nose by altering the pitch of the tail rotor.
4. **Throttle**: Maintains rotor RPM to ensure sufficient lift.

**Flight Conditions**
- **Hovering**: Requires constant control inputs to counteract the helicopter’s generated gusty air.
- **Forward Flight**: Uses cyclic and collective controls to manage speed and altitude.
