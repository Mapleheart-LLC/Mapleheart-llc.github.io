**Introduction**
- Title 14 CFR part 91 requires compliance with operating limitations specified in rotorcraft flight manuals (RFMs).
- RFMs have a standardized format set by the General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA).
- The term “Pilot’s Operating Handbook (POH)” is often used interchangeably with “Rotorcraft Flight Manual (RFM)” but must indicate FAA approval if titled as POH.

**Sections of the RFM**
1. **General Information**
   - Descriptive information about the rotorcraft and powerplant.
   - Dimensions and basic details of components are provided.
   - Includes definitions, abbreviations, and symbology.

2. **Operating Limitations**
   - Contains limitations required by regulations for safe operation.
   - Includes airspeed, altitude, rotor, and powerplant limitations, instrument markings, and placards.
   - **Instrument Markings**: Green for continuous operation, red for maximum/minimum limits, and yellow for caution.
   - **Airspeed Limitations**: Depicted by color coding on the airspeed indicator.
   - **Altitude Limitations**: Maximum operating density altitude specified.
   - **Rotor Limitations**: Minimum and maximum rotor RPM values indicated.
   - **Powerplant Limitations**: Includes RPM range, power limits, operating temperatures, and fuel/oil requirements.
   - **Placards**: Display important operating limitations within the cabin.

3. **Emergency Procedures**
   - Checklists for handling various emergencies like engine failure, tail rotor failure, and fires.
   - Manufacturers may include abnormal procedures for handling non-emergency malfunctions.

4. **Normal Procedures**
   - Most frequently used section, including airspeeds and checklists for preflight, starting, ground checks, takeoff, approach, landing, and shutdown.
   - Encourages the use of checklists to avoid skipping important steps.

5. **Performance**
   - Contains information and performance charts required by regulations to ensure safe operation.
   - Examples include calibrated vs. indicated airspeed conversion, hovering ceiling vs. gross weight, and height-velocity diagrams.

6. **Weight and Balance**
   - Information necessary to calculate weight and balance, including sample problems.
   - Details the maximum certificated weights and center of gravity (CG) range.

7. **Aircraft and Systems Description**
   - Describes all systems found on the aircraft in an understandable manner.
   - Important for pilots to study for operational knowledge.

8. **Handling, Servicing, and Maintenance**
   - Includes maintenance and inspection recommendations and regulatory requirements.
   - Provides preventative maintenance tips and ground handling procedures.

9. **Supplements**
   - Information for operating optional equipment installed on the helicopter.
   - Pilots need to read supplements to integrate new procedures into daily checklists.

10. **Safety and Operational Tips**
   - Optional section with best operating practices and safety recommendations.
   - Topics may include physiological factors, weather information, fuel conservation, and low rotor RPM considerations.
