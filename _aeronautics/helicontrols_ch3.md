**Introduction**
- Helicopter pilots use three major controls: collective pitch control, cyclic pitch control, and antitorque pedals/tail rotor control.
- Additionally, the throttle control is used, typically mounted to the collective pitch control.
- The chapter describes these controls, applicable to various helicopter configurations, assuming counterclockwise main rotor rotation.

**Key Controls**

1. **Collective Pitch Control**:
   - Located on the left side of the pilot's seat and operated with the left hand.
   - Adjusts the pitch angle of all main rotor blades simultaneously.
   - Raising the collective increases pitch angle and drag, lowering rotor RPM; lowering it decreases pitch angle and drag, increasing rotor RPM.
   - Requires throttle adjustments or a governor to maintain constant rotor RPM.

2. **Throttle Control**:
   - Regulates engine RPM.
   - Twist grip throttle is used, rotating away from the pilot increases RPM, towards decreases RPM.
   - Governors and correlators help maintain RPM by adjusting engine power automatically with collective changes.
   - Piston helicopters require manual coordination of throttle and collective adjustments.

3. **Cyclic Pitch Control**:
   - Located between the pilot’s legs or between pilot seats.
   - Tilts the rotor disk in the direction the cyclic is moved, controlling horizontal direction of travel.
   - Changes pitch angle of the rotor blades approximately 90° before and after cyclic displacement direction.

4. **Antitorque Pedals**:
   - Located on the cabin floor by the pilot's feet.
   - Controls the pitch of the tail rotor blades, counteracting the main rotor's torque.
   - Allows for heading control during hover and forward flight.
   - Adjusting pedal input changes the tail rotor's thrust, yawing the helicopter nose left or right.

**Heading Control**:
- Tail rotor provides heading control and counters torque.
- Pedal inputs adjust tail rotor pitch angle to control yaw.
- Positive pitch angle moves tail right, negative pitch angle moves tail left.
- Vertical fin/stabilizer aids in directional stability, especially at zero tail rotor thrust.

**Rotor Configurations**:
- **Tandem Rotor**: Uses two large horizontal rotors rotating in opposite directions to counteract torque without a tail rotor.
- **Intermeshing Rotor Systems**: Two rotors turning in opposite directions, slightly angled to avoid collision, controlled by heading pedals.
- **Coaxial Rotor Systems**: Rotors mounted one above the other on the same shaft, turning in opposite directions, heading controlled by torque imbalance.
