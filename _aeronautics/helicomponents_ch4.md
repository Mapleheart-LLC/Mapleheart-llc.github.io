**Introduction**
- Discusses components, sections, and systems of modern helicopters.
- Knowledge of these components helps in recognizing malfunctions and managing emergencies.
- Understanding system relationships aids in informed decision-making and corrective actions.

**Airframe**
- Made from metal, wood, or composite materials, or combinations.
- Composite components typically consist of fiber-impregnated resins forming smooth panels.
- Airframe design involves engineering, aerodynamics, materials technology, and manufacturing methods to balance performance, reliability, and cost.

**Fuselage**
- Main body housing the cabin, engine, transmission, avionics, flight controls, and powerplant.
- Cabins vary in seating arrangements, with pilots commonly seated on the right.

**Main Rotor System**
- The rotor system generates lift and consists of the mast, hub, and rotor blades.
- Main rotor systems are classified into semirigid, rigid, and fully articulated.
  - **Semirigid Rotor System**: 
    - Two blades rigidly mounted to the hub, tilting together on a teetering hinge.
    - Capable of feathering to change the pitch angle.
    - Vulnerable to mast bumping.
  - **Rigid Rotor System**:
    - Structurally complex with blades absorbing loads by bending.
    - Very responsive, less susceptible to mast bumping, and easier to maintain.
  - **Fully Articulated Rotor System**:
    - Blades can lead/lag, flap, and feather independently.
    - Found on helicopters with more than two main rotor blades.
  - **Bearingless Rotor System**:
    - Related to the articulated system but without bearings or hinges.

**Rotor Configurations**
- **Tandem Rotor**: Two large horizontal rotors, counter-rotating to cancel torque.
- **Coaxial Rotors**: Rotors mounted on the same shaft, turning in opposite directions, eliminating the need for a tail rotor.
- **Intermeshing Rotors**: Two rotors turning in opposite directions with intermeshing blades, eliminating the need for an antitorque system.

**Swash Plate Assembly**
- Converts stationary control inputs into rotating inputs for rotor blades.
- Consists of stationary and rotating swash plates connected by a uniball sleeve.

**Freewheeling Unit**
- Disengages the engine from the main rotor if engine RPM is less than main rotor RPM.
- Allows the main and tail rotors to continue turning during engine failure.

**Antitorque System**
- Single main rotor helicopters require an antitorque system, usually a tail rotor, to counteract torque.
- **Fenestron**: Shrouded tail rotor system for safety during ground operations.
- **NOTARÂ®**: Uses the Coanda effect for directional control, reducing mechanical disadvantages.

**Engines**
- **Reciprocating Engines**: Used in smaller helicopters, simple and inexpensive.
- **Turbine Engines**: More powerful, used in various helicopters, with components including compressor, combustion chamber, turbine, and accessory gearbox assembly.

**Transmission System**
- Transfers power from the engine to the main and tail rotors.
- Main rotor transmission reduces engine RPM to optimal rotor RPM.
- **Dual Tachometers**: Show engine and rotor RPM or a percentage of each, indicating the coupled state during operation.

**Clutch**
- Separates the engine and rotor during startup.
- **Belt Drive Clutch**: Utilizes belts to transmit power, engaging gradually.
- **Centrifugal Clutch**: Uses centrifugal force to engage the transmission drum as engine speed increases.

**Fuel Systems**
- Comprise fuel supply and control systems.
- **Fuel Supply System**: Includes tanks, gauges, shut-off valve, filter, and pumps.
- **Carburetor Heat and Fuel Injection**: Manage fuel mixture and prevent carburetor icing.

**Electrical Systems**
- 14- or 28-volt direct-current systems powered by alternators or starter/generators.
- Includes bus bars, voltage regulators, and batteries for power distribution and emergency use.

**Hydraulics**
- Used to overcome high control forces in larger helicopters.
- Systems include actuators, pumps, and reservoirs for hydraulic fluid management.

**Stability Augmentation Systems**
- **Force Trim**: Holds cyclic position using a magnetic clutch and springs.
- **Active Augmentation Systems**: Use electric actuators and computers for control assistance.

**Autopilot**
- Can fly the helicopter and maintain selected functions like altitude and heading hold.
- Systems vary in complexity, with advanced systems capable of performing instrument approaches.

**Environmental Systems**
- Heating and cooling provided by ram air, air conditioning, or heat exchangers.
- **Anti-Icing Systems**: Use bleed air for engine and airframe anti-icing.
