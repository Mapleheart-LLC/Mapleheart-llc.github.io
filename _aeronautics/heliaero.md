#### Key Points

1. **Venturi Effect**:
   - Describes how the velocity of air increases while static pressure decreases as air flows through a constricted tube.
   - Important in understanding pressure differentials that generate aerodynamic force on rotor blades.

2. **Newtonâ€™s Third Law of Motion**:
   - Lift is also provided by the rotor blade's lower surface as air is deflected downward, producing an upward (lifting) reaction.

3. **Weight and Lift**:
   - To lift off, the rotor disk must generate enough lift to overcome the helicopter's weight.
   - This is achieved by increasing the pitch angle of the main rotor blades.

4. **Induced Flow (Downwash)**:
   - When blade pitch angle increases, the rotor disk induces a downward flow of air, decreasing the angle of attack (AOA) due to downwash.
   - More pronounced during hover under no-wind conditions.

5. **Resultant Relative Wind**:
   - Inclined downward at some angle and opposite the effective flight path of the airfoil.
   - Modified by airspeed and affects lift, drag, and total aerodynamic force vectors on the airfoil.

6. **Autorotation**:
   - A state of flight where the main rotor disk is turned by air moving up through the rotor rather than engine power.
   - Enabled by a freewheeling unit that disengages the engine from the main rotor during engine failure.
   - Allows for safe landing in case of engine failure.
   - Includes vertical autorotation and forward autorotation.

7. **Autorotation Descent**:
   - Pilot must flare the helicopter to decelerate before landing.
   - Adjustments to the collective are necessary to keep the RPM within operating limits.
