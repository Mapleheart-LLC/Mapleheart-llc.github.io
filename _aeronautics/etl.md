#### Definition
- **Effective Translational Lift (ETL)**: The increased lift that occurs when a helicopter transitions from hover to forward flight, typically between 16-24 knots.

#### Key Points
1. **Transition from Hover to Forward Flight**:
   - In hover, the rotor blades generate lift but also cause significant vortices (turbulence) that reduce efficiency.
   - As the helicopter moves forward, it outruns these vortices, resulting in smoother airflow over the rotor blades.

2. **Increased Lift**:
   - ETL is marked by a noticeable increase in lift due to the more efficient airflow.
   - The rotor system becomes more effective, reducing the power required to maintain altitude.

3. **Aerodynamic Changes**:
   - Forward motion reduces the induced drag and the rotor blades encounter less disturbed air.
   - This transition improves overall aerodynamic efficiency.

4. **Pilot Experience**:
   - Pilots experience a distinct change in performance: the helicopter feels as if it suddenly gains extra lift.
   - This change usually occurs around 16-24 knots, but the exact speed can vary with different helicopter models and conditions.

5. **Implications for Flight**:
   - Understanding ETL is crucial for safe and efficient takeoffs and landings.
   - Pilots need to be aware of the increased lift and adjust their controls accordingly.

#### Practical Considerations
- **Takeoff**:
  - During takeoff, pilots often aim to quickly pass through the ETL speed range to benefit from the increased lift and reduced power demand.
  
- **Landing**:
  - During landing, pilots must manage the loss of ETL as the helicopter decelerates, requiring more power to maintain altitude and control.

- **Hover**:
  - In hover, especially in ground effect, the helicopter may require more power due to the reduced efficiency without ETL.
