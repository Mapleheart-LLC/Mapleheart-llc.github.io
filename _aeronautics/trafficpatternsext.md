### Traffic Patterns

A traffic pattern is a standard path followed by aircraft when taking off or landing, and it ensures safe separation of aircraft in the vicinity of an airport. For helicopters, the traffic pattern includes five main segments:

1. **Upwind:**
   - **From hover/ground 60 kt to 300 ft:**
     - This is the initial phase after takeoff.
     - The helicopter climbs out from the ground, transitioning from a hover to forward flight.
     - The speed is increased to 60 knots (kt) while climbing to an altitude of 300 feet.

2. **Crosswind:**
   - **300 -> 500 ft @ 60 kt:**
     - After reaching 300 feet, the helicopter turns 90 degrees to the left or right (depending on the traffic pattern direction) into the crosswind leg.
     - The helicopter continues to climb to 500 feet while maintaining a speed of 60 knots.

3. **Downwind:**
   - **500 ft @ 70 kt:**
     - Once at 500 feet, the helicopter turns again to fly parallel to the runway but in the opposite direction of landing.
     - The speed is increased to 70 knots.
     - During this leg, the pilot performs downwind checks, which typically include checking engine instruments, fuel, and other critical systems in preparation for landing.

4. **Base:**
   - **500 -> 300 ft @ 60 kt:**
     - The helicopter turns 90 degrees again to enter the base leg.
     - During this segment, the helicopter begins its descent from 500 feet to 300 feet.
     - The speed is reduced back to 60 knots.

5. **Final:**
   - **300 -> approach @ 60 kt:**
     - The final leg is the last segment before landing.
     - The helicopter turns onto the final approach, aligned with the runway or landing area.
     - The descent continues from 300 feet to the appropriate approach altitude.
     - The speed is maintained at 60 knots.

### Approaches

Approaches refer to the descent and landing phase of the flight. Different types of approaches are used based on the available power, obstacles, and desired descent rate:

1. **Shallow Approach:**
   - **Very slow gentle descent:**
     - The descent is very gradual.
     - This approach is used when there is not enough power available for a steeper descent.
   - **~5 degrees:**
     - The descent angle is approximately 5 degrees.

2. **Normal Approach:**
   - **Gentle descent:**
     - The descent rate is moderate and controlled.
   - **~10 degrees:**
     - The descent angle is approximately 10 degrees.

3. **Steep Approach:**
   - **Faster descent:**
     - The descent rate is faster compared to normal and shallow approaches.
     - This approach is used to avoid obstacles such as trees or buildings.
   - **15-20 degrees:**
     - The descent angle is steeper, ranging from 15 to 20 degrees.

These traffic patterns and approaches ensure that helicopter operations are safe and efficient, especially when operating in and out of airports or other controlled environments.
