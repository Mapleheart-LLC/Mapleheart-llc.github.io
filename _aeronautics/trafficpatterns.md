2. crosswind
    300 -> 500 ft @ 60 kt
3. downwind
    500 ft 70 kt
    downwind checks
4. base
    500 -> 300 ft @ 60kt
5. final
    300 -> approach @ 60 kt

Shallow approach
    very slow gentle decent
    ~5 degrees
    for when thereâ€™s not enough power
Normal approach
    gentle decent
    ~10 degrees

Steep approach
    faster decent
