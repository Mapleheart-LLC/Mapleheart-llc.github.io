**Bernoulli's Principle:**
- Bernoulli's principle states that an increase in the speed of a fluid occurs simultaneously with a decrease in pressure.
- In mathematical terms, for an incompressible, steady-flowing fluid, the sum of its pressure energy, kinetic energy, and potential energy per unit volume is constant.

**Application to Helicopters:**
- **Rotor Blades as Airfoils:** 
  - The rotor blades of a helicopter function as airfoils (similar to airplane wings).
  - As the rotor blades spin, they create differences in air pressure above and below the blades.
- **Lift Generation:**
  - The shape of the rotor blades is designed to have a curved upper surface and a flatter lower surface.
  - As the blades rotate, air moves faster over the curved upper surface and slower under the flatter lower surface.
  - According to Bernoulli's principle, the faster-moving air over the top of the blade has lower pressure compared to the slower-moving air underneath.
  - This pressure difference generates lift, which is the force that allows the helicopter to rise and stay airborne.
- **Variable Pitch:**
  - Helicopter blades can change their pitch (angle of attack) to control the amount of lift produced.
  - Increasing the pitch angle increases the pressure difference and therefore increases lift, allowing the helicopter to climb.
  - Decreasing the pitch angle reduces the lift, allowing the helicopter to descend.
- **Hovering:**
  - For a helicopter to hover, the lift generated by the rotor blades must exactly balance the weight of the helicopter.
  - Pilots adjust the collective pitch control to maintain a stable hover.
- **Forward Flight:**
  - When a helicopter transitions to forward flight, the advancing and retreating blades experience different relative wind speeds.
  - The advancing blade (moving in the direction of flight) encounters faster airflow, increasing lift.
  - The retreating blade (moving opposite to the direction of flight) encounters slower airflow, reducing lift.
  - To balance these differences, the rotor system uses a mechanism called "cyclic pitch control," which adjusts the pitch of each blade individually as it rotates.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Rotor Blade Design:** Airfoil shape to exploit Bernoulli's principle.
- **Lift:** Result of pressure differential caused by varying airspeeds above and below the rotor blades.
- **Pitch Control:** Adjusts lift by changing the angle of attack.
- **Hovering and Forward Flight:** Involves balancing lift and managing differences in lift across rotor blades.
