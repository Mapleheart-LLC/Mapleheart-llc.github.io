**Introduction**
- Complying with weight and balance limits is crucial for helicopter safety and performance.
- Exceeding the maximum weight limit compromises structural integrity and affects handling.
- Center of Gravity (CG) deviations, even small ones, can dramatically alter helicopter handling characteristics.
- Operating outside weight and balance limits is unsafe.

**Key Concepts**

1. **Weight**:
   - Consider the weight of the basic helicopter, crew, passengers, cargo, and fuel.
   - Effective weight varies during flight; planning must ensure the helicopter can handle weight throughout all phases of flight.
   - Maximum allowable weight may need adjustment based on density altitude changes.

2. **Basic Empty Weight**:
   - Includes the weight of the helicopter, optional equipment, unusable fuel, and operating fluids (engine and transmission oil, hydraulic fluid).
   - "Licensed empty weight" may not include full oil, only undrainable oil.

3. **Maximum Gross Weight**:
   - Internal maximum gross weight: within the helicopter structure.
   - External maximum gross weight: includes external loads, varying based on attachment points.

4. **Weight Limitations**:
   - Necessary to ensure structural integrity and predict performance.
   - Operating below minimum weight can affect handling and autorotational characteristics.
   - Operating above maximum weight can lead to structural failure, fatigue, and poor performance under adverse conditions.

5. **Balance**:
   - Proper CG is essential for safe operation; it affects handling and control.
   - Forward CG: heavy nose, requires rearward cyclic, difficult to control as fuel burns.
   - Aft CG: tail-low attitude, excessive forward cyclic needed, dangerous in gusty conditions.
   - Lateral balance: usually not a concern, but certain conditions may require checking lateral CG.

6. **Weight and Balance Calculations**:
   - Ensure gross weight is within limits and CG is within the allowable range.
   - Use actual weights when available for accuracy.
   - Reference datum: an imaginary vertical plane for measuring horizontal distances for balance purposes.

**Common Terms and Their Meanings**:

- **Basic Empty Weight**: Weight of the helicopter with all operating fluids but no usable fuel or payload.
- **Maximum Gross Weight**: The maximum allowable weight of the helicopter, including internal and external loads.
- **Reference Datum**: An imaginary point for measuring all horizontal distances in weight and balance calculations.
- **CG (Center of Gravity)**: The point where the helicopter balances; critical for stability and control.
