excerpt: 'Airways define routes for IFR aircraft, generally within controlled airspace from 1,200 ft AGL up to 17,999 ft MSL, and restricted areas like MOAs and alert areas are marked to indicate potential dangers or military activity. Special use airspaces such as Military Training Routes, Temporary Flight Restrictions, National Wildlife Refuges, and the highly regulated airspace around Washington D.C. have specific rules and requirements, including altitude limits, special training, and strict security measures.'

### Airway Dimensions

- Designed to define routes for IFR aircraft
- Generally 4 NM on either side of the center-line[^1]
- Controlled airspace
- Class E floor 1,200 ft AGL up to and including 17,999 ft MSL[^2][^3]

### Restricted Areas and Warning Areas

- Also known as "Special Use Airspace"
- Generally because of danger to civilian/commercial aircraft, such as aerial gunnery or guided missiles
- Restricted areas are marked with hash-marks and R e.g., "R-2503B & C"
- Check chart legend to see if able to (and how, if possible) to fly through Restricted Airspace
- Can also get permission from the controlling agency 
- Warning areas are designated by "Warning" e.g., "W-50b"
- Can fly in Warning areas anytime you want to

### Military Operations Areas and Alert Areas

- **Military Operations Areas**:
  - Designated by magenta hash-marks
  - Shortened to MOA
  - Military training
  - VFR pilots can fly through at any time, just make sure to keep an eye out
- **Alert Areas**:
  - High volume/unusual type of military activity
  - Military jet training, e.g., Students flying jets
  - All pilots, without exception, are responsible for looking out for other craft

### Military Training Routes

- The military can fly at any speed they want to along these routes
  - Possible sonic booms
  - Flying at speeds of 250+ knots
- Marked by IR or VR e.g., "IR644-469"
- Can have a 3 or 4 digit number:
  - 4 digit number means below 1,500 ft AGL[^2]
  - 3 digit number means above or below 1,500 ft AGL[^2]
- IR can be done in instrument only conditions
- VR can only be done in visual conditions

### Temporary Flight Restrictions

- TFRs can be issued for several reasons:
  - VIP transport (VP/P)
  - Spaceflights
  - Firefighting
- Violating can get you in deep trouble
- National Security Areas (NSA) are put into place when there is an added need for security for ground 

### National Wildlife Refuges

- Marked by blue line with dots inside of the area
- Fly no lower than 2,000 ft AGL[^2]

### Flying Around Washington D.C.

- The most regulated airspace in the US
- To fly within 60 NM requires a Special Awareness Training Course[^1]
- Surface up to 18,000 ft MSL[^3]
- File an IFR or SFRA flight plan for VFR
- Mode C transponder with assigned code[^3]
- Two-way radio communications established before entering the airspace

**Flight Restricted Zone**:
- Radius of 15 NM centered around DC Airport[^1]
- Surface up to 18,000 ft MSL[^3]
- Requires background check
- Requires PIN from TSA
- Use of deadly force is authorized if no requirements are met
