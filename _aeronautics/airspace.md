title: "Airspace Classes"
collection: publications
permalink: /aeronautics/airspace
excerpt: 'Airspace classes are standardized from A to G, with A being the highest (above 18,000 ft MSL) and G being uncontrolled. Classes A through E require varying degrees of communication and equipment, while class G is uncontrolled; specific requirements apply to each class, such as communication with Control Towers and specific transponder usage.'

#### Abbreviations:
- ft: foot/feet[^1]
- AGL: Above Ground Level[^2]
- CT: Control Tower[^3]
- VHF: Variable High Frequency[^4]
- NM: Nautical Miles[^5]
- establ.: established[^6]
- MSL: Mean Sea Level[^7]

#### Standardizes Airspaces Between All

- **A**: Altitude 18k ft +[^1]
- **B**: Big Big airplanes
- **C**: Congested Radar help
- **D**: Dialogue (first start having control towers)[^3]
- **E**: Everywhere else thatâ€™s not a higher class
- **G**: Go for it, uncontrolled, no need to talk to anyone

#### Controlled: ABCDE
- Provides separation for flights

#### Uncontrolled: G

#### Using Class E&G Airspace

- **E**: floor of 1200 AGL[^2]
  - Magenta shaded: class E drop to 700 AGL[^2]
  - Fuzzy blue: 1200 AGL[^2]
  - Magenta dash line: class E to ground
  - Can go up to, not including, 18,000 ft AGL[^1][^2]
  
- **G**: up to 14,500 AGL unless into other class E area depending on area[^2]

#### Class D

- Shown with a blue segmented circle
- To be able to fly in class D, must talk to CT[^3]
- Generally in a circle
- Vertical limit: 2500 ft above airport - [limit] in square[^1]
- Lateral dimensions of class D airspace are based on the instrument procedures for which the controlled airspace is established

**Requirements for Class D**:
- VHF transmitter and receiver[^4]
- Communication required regardless of weather conditions
- Have to contact tower at any point within the class D airspace to be able to fly through/land/take-off
- No clearance required
- Required to follow tower instructions
- Clearance required to take-off/land at primary airport
- Landing at secondary requires clearance from primary
- Taking off from secondary requires communication to primary as soon as you can
- Tower **does not** provide separation service from other aircraft in the air, only runway/taxi
- Tower **does** provide advisories/traffic alerts
- Class D airspace is only when the CT is in operation -> becomes Class E/G if not in operation[^2]
- Check Chart Supplement for airport information to see when airspace changes and to what

#### Class C

- Areas where traffic/passage count is high
- Shown on chart with solid magenta line
- Standardised size and shape
  - Surrounds a primary airport
  - Inner circle/surface area that goes 5 NM from airport goes from surface to 4,000' AGL[^2][^5]
  - Height shown on chart in area as <ceiling>/<floor> e.g., 41/13
  - Outer Circle is 10 NM from the airport[^5]
  - 20 NM from airport is outer area (procedural outer area) - call around here[^5]
  - Outer Circle starts at 1,200 ft on standard shape and goes up to 4,000 ft[^1]

**Class C Airspace Equipment and Communications**:
- Required Equipment:
  - Two-way radio
  - Mode C transponder (required up to 10,000 ft MSL)[^1][^7] (4096 transponder)
  - Encoding Altimeter
- Two-way communication must be established, clearance not required
  - Communication establ. when controlled reads back full N (registration) number[^6]
  - *Denied clearance if no N number in reply*
  - Must follow TC instructions
- Satellite/Secondary Airport operation:
  - Taking off: establ. communication on the ground[^6]
    - if not able, then as soon as possible
  - Landing: Clearance needed

#### Class B Airspace

- Dark Blue Solid lines on chart
- **Clearance required to enter**
- establ. around busy-busy airports[^6]
- Usually have one primary and several secondary
- Non-standardized size and shape
  - Height shown on chart in area as <ceiling>/<floor> e.g., 100/SFC[^6]
  
**Class B Airspace Requirements**:
- Private Pilot or higher
- Student Pilot with the correct logbook endorsements
  - Within last 90 days competent to solo
- Communications radio
  - Must gain clearance to enter class bravo airspace
- Able to navigate
- 4096 code transponder with Mode C and an encoding altimeter[^7]
  - Transponder required 30 NM out from primary airport up to 10,000 ft[^1]

#### Class A Airspace Details

- 18,000 ft MSL up until 60,000 ft MSL[^1][^7]
- IFR rated & Current
- IFR equipped
- IFR clearance at altitude assigned by ATC
- Transponder with automatic altitude reporting (Mode C)[^7]
- Separation for all aircraft is provided
- VFR prohibited
