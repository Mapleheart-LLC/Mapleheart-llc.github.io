&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humans are a social species, and we instinctively follow a social hierarchy. Deep down us humans have the basic need become the leader of the pack, or rather the social leaders. While people do become political leaders to satisfy this need, some people find an easier way: amassing a massive group of fans across the nation or even the world. Indeed, the whole idea of having fans can be related back to the notion of a tribe/pack. Going back over sixty million years before humans were even a species, this was a thing! Yes, there were outliers, hermits and loners, but their genes did not propagate as commonly in future generations - causing the ones who went together in groups to pass their genes down. Grouping up is actually in our genes! When there is a group, there is almost always a leader - whether it be to allow the blame to be passed onto that person or the group does not want to wish to make decisions that may end badly. The reason why there are celebrities is to satiate the "hunger" either making decisions or leaving decisions up to someone else. Humankind has this need for a leader and celebrities are able to use this need to take advantage of the common folk to get rich or famous.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The whole concept that people can rise to fame is pretty silly, that people can gather a large group of people (because let's face it, you don't get counted as a celebrity unless you have tens of thousands of fans/followers) and keep their interest for their continued support over the course of months or even years! The idea which allows people to just exploit the everyday person. While most people do wish to be famous, there are some people who are famous that don't wish to be. Take for example: lottery winners, these tend to do whatever they can to avoid actually becoming known as the "person who won the lottery." Which if they fail at doing so, they can suffer via being a target for more robberies than not.
