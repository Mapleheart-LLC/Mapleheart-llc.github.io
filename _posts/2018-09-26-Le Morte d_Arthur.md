This excerpt from Malory’s famous work is the story of **<span class="underline">Sir Griflet’s</span>** clash with the Knight of The Fountain, Arthur’s confrontation with the same knight, and Arthur’s receipt of the sword of kings, **<span class="underline">Excalibur</span>** from the Lady of the Lake. Sir Griflet is one of Arthur’s earliest allies, and one of the first of the Round Table knights. In the ***Lancelot - Grail Cycle***, he was one of the few survivors of the **Battle of Camlann** and was the one who the dying Arthur asked to return Excalibur to the Lady of the Lake. In Malory, however, **<span class="underline">Sir Bedivere</span>** was the knight who cast Excalibur was the knight who cast Excalibur into the lake.

**<span class="underline">Paragraph</span> <span class="underline">I</span>**

**<span class="underline">Style</span>** - note the archaic diction of this and the rest of the work - this is a translation from Middle English.

**<span class="underline">Tone</span>** - this is a Chivalric tale, and, as such, begins with an injustice that must be rectified - Griflet is young, impetuous, and wants to be knighted so that he can test his prowess.

**<span class="underline">Paragraph</span> <span class="underline">IV</span>**

“Thou shalt promise me by the faith of thy body…” - remember that in Medieval times, the body was considered holy, so swearing by it is to swear a solemn oath.

Oh don’t do this, you’re too young.

**<span class="underline">Sir Pellinore’s</span>** concern for Grifliet’s wounds is characteristic of the Code of Chivalry - his placing the wounded Griflet on his horse and returning him to Arthur is further evidence of this.

Despite Sir Pellinore’s generosity, make note of Arthur’s anger over the wounding Sir Griflet\! - significant\!

**<span class="underline">p. 101 - right column</span>**

Again, according to the code, because Arthur has been defeated by the Knight of The Fountain, he’s supposed to pledge loyalty to the victor - thus, his dismay at Merlin for having “killed” the knight as Pelinore was about to slay Arthur. Merlin has only cast a sleeping spell, to save Arthur’s life.

**<span class="underline">p. 101-102</span>**

Because Arthur’s sword was broken in the fight with Sir Pelinore, he now needs a new one - thus, the introduction of the magical sword, **<span class="underline">Excalibur</span>**, which Arthur receives from the **<span class="underline">Lady of The Lake</span>**.

**<span class="underline">Theme</span>** - Arthur must promise “a gift” to the Lady of the Lake in exchange for the sword - the gift is unspecified. Establishing ***fealty*** (faithfulness, allegiance, loyalty) through mutal responsibility was an enduring Medieval concept.

**<span class="underline">plot</span>** - Merlin informs Arthur that he is unwise to value the sword more than its **<span class="underline">scabbard</span>**, for as long as he wears the scabbard, he can’t be injured - the enchanted scabbard is a typical supernatural element in the chivalric **<span class="underline">romance</span>**.
