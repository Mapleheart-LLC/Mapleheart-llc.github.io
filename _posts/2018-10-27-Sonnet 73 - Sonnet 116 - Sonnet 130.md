Shakespeare wrote 154 sonnets in his cycle – probably composed in the 1590’s in response to Sidney’s Astrophel and Stella cycle, but not published until 1609.
	Sonnets 1–126 are addressed to a young man whom the speaker admired
	Sonnets 127–152 are addressed to an unknown lady with dark hair, eyes, 
			               and complexion. 
“Sonnet 73”

ll. 1-5 –  imagery –  fall and winter images in poetry almost always suggest old age
                                 and the end of life
l. 8 –  “…Death’s second self…” –  this is a metaphor indicating sleep
ll. 9-12 –  the very fire of youth has now consumed life – old age and death are all that
                  remain.
ll. 13-14 –  **couplet** –  in Shakespeare, the function of the couplet is always to make 
                                 clear the _theme_ – here, in the face of death, human love acquires
                                    added importance.

Sonnet 116

ll. 1-2 - the speaker begins by stating that the true "marriage" of two like minds has no obstacles ("impediments")
ll. 2-4 - true love isn't altered by external forces - it doesn't change, but remains constant.
l. 5-6 - the speaker says that love is an "ever-fixed mark" - again it is a constant
l. 7 - **metaphor** - love is compared here to a star in the night sky that guides a ship ("bark")
ll. 9-10 - **personification** - nice lines here - love, although constant, is subject to passing of time - time's "bending stickle's compass" is a wonderful ***metaphor*** for death
ll. 11-12 - love will persist until the end of time - the last judgement ("edge of doom")







 “Sonnet 130”

This sonnet may not be about a specific woman (her identity has always been a mystery), but may simply be a parody of the common sonnets of the day that praised female beauty by comparing it to the sun, roses, goddesses, etc.

ll. 1-12 –  the speaker spends the entire time expressing what his lover is not! (in terms
                  of beauty)
ll. 13-14 –  couplet –  shifts to a celebration of the lady and, more importantly, to love
                                   without illusion.
