With regard to English Literature, the **romantic** period is generally accepted to have begun with the pubication of *Lyrical Ballads* by William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge in **1798**, however, romanticism actually had stronger roots in Europe and developed somewhat earlier.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The word "romantic" was first used in **Germany** in 1798 by the critics Friedrich and Augest Von Schlegal - the word "**romance**" originally referred to medieval tales of knightly adventures written in the French derivative of the orginal **Roman** (or romance) language, ***Latin***.

These tales often involved the amorous encounters between an knight and his lady - thus, the modern meanings of the words "romance" and "romantic."

For our purposes of study, remember that **romance**, from the literary perspective, refers to the "freely imaginative idealizing fiction" and ***not*** love between a man and a woman.

**Romanticism** can be best defined through comparison to the **neoclassical** age which preceded it - the age of Dryden, Pope, Swift, and Johnson.

| Inspired by classical Greek and Roman authors               	| Inspired by the innate beauty of the **pastoral** world (nature) - also took a revitalised interest in medieval subjects and settings as well as the **supernatural** 	|

Historically, the Romantic Age was an important period of **revolution** and change.

- The American Revolution (1776)
- The French Revolution (1789)
- The Industrial Revolution

While the orginal ideas behind the French Revolution were embraced by most intellectuals, the chaotic, bloody aftermath (the **Reign of Terror** and the rise of **Napoleon Bonaparte** <sup>yes, he really was 5'2".</sup>) were met with disillusionment and despair.  

Even more important, however, was the influence of the Industrial Revolution, which marks the beginning of our modern age - James Watt's perfection of the **steam engine** in 1765 helped to change forever the face of the British industry and the lives of British workers - with the coming of the Industrial Age came the birth of urban, industrial cities, and all that accompanied them:

- poor wages
- slums and ghettos 
- child labour
- exploitation of the worker
- destruction of the enviroment (air and water)
- more acute division of people into two classes - wealthy property owners with economic and political power, and the poor wage earners with no rights or possessions.

England suffered from poor leadership during this era - **George III** was declared incurably insane in 1811 - his son The Prince of Wales acted as Regent until 1820 - the era of "The Regency" was a time of lavish social display and indulgence by the rich - British leadership cared little about the critical problems of society or the hardships of the working class.

The Romantic writers of the period felt all these various social and political problems acutely and reflected these feelings in their work - the poets of this era are, perhaps, the finest in the history of the English Language!

**Major Poets of the Romantic Age**
