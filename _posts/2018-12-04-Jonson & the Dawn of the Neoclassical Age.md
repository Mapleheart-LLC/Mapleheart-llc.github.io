The work of the poet/playwright **Ben Jonson** represents a move away from the flowery and emotional love sonnets and lyrics of the Elizabethans and towards what would eventually become the **Neoclassical Period**, an era that valued a more tightly crafted, more restrained style of writing based on the classical ideals of **<span class="underline">order</span>, <span class="underline">balance</span>,** and **<span class="underline">harmony</span>**. Jonson and the Cavalier poets who admired and followed him were instrumental in transitioning to this new poetic style, as is evident in the comparison below:

### Blow, Blow, Thou Winter Wind
#### William Shakespeare
```
Blow, blow, thou winter wind.
Thou art not so unkind
As man’s ingratitude.
Thy tooth is not so keen,
Because thou art not seen, 
Although thy breath be rude.
Heigh-ho! Sing, heigh-ho! unto the green holly.
Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly.
Then, heigh-ho, the holly!
This life is most jolly. 
Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,
That dost not bite so nigh
As benefits forgot.
Though thou the waters warp,
Thy sting is not so sharp 
As friend remembered not.
Heigh-ho! Sing, heigh-ho! unto the green holly.
Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly.
Then, heigh-ho, the holly!
This life is most jolly. 
```

### Song: to Celia
#### Ben Jonson
```
Drink to me only with thine eyes,
And I will pledge with mine;
Or leave a kiss but in the cup,
And I’ll not look for wine
The thirst that from the soul doth rise 
Doth ask a drink divine;
But might I of Jove’s nectar sup,
I would not change for thine.
I sent thee late a rosy wreath,
Not so much honouring thee 
As giving it a hope, that there
It could not withered be.
But thou thereon didst only breathe,
And sent’st it back to me;
Since with it grows, and smells, I swear, 
Not of itself, but thee.
```
