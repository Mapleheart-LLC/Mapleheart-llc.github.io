### Background 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1664 and 1665, more than 70,000 died of plague in London alone (pre-plague population was more than 500,000). The effects of the plague were horrifying. The initial symptom was swellings, which appeared in the groin or armpits, some as large as an apple. These eventually spread in all directions over the body. Black or red spots then broke out and, eventually, the lymphatic system became infected. Glands became swollen and inflamed, further swellings caused bleeding underneath the skin as death approached. Delirium was the result of the disease’s effect on the central nervous system.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defoe’s journalistic style shows in the *narrator’s* focus on the externals of the event rather than on the thoughts of the people. Defoe was only about 4 years old when the plague was raging, so his account is based on the recollections of those who were there and survived, official records, etc. His **point-of-view** is significant in the telling of this story – the entire passage is an excellent study in the use of ***verisimilitude***

### Paragraph I
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Setting* is important in the opening paragraph - Defoe makes use of **personification** to describe the "face" of London and its surrounding areas - he achieves an emotional response in the reader by focusing on the plague's effects on families and those that feel they "should be summoned in the next hour...."  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Paragraph II, III, & IV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, in describing the great pit where the dead were placed, Defoe illustrates a more journalistic style by describing the pit's specific dimensions and the various problems associated with its use. Also, discussing the numbers of dead thrown into the pit helps Defoe capture the sheer horror of the plague's devastation.

### Paragraph V
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The discription here of the behaviour of those in the final stages of the disease is particularly harrrowing.

### Paragraph VII
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The narrator's compulsive desire to visit the pit, despite the warnings of the sexton<a href="#note1" id="note1ref"><sup>1</sup></a>
, illustrate humanity's frequent need to "view the catastrophe." The narrator thinks of it as a possible chance for spiritual growth - an "instructing sight."

### Paragraphs VIII & IX
In relating the incident of the greiving father in the brown cloak, Defoe makes use of *pathos*<a href="#note2" id="note2ref"><sup>2</sup></a>
, which is the quality in a work of literature or art that arouses the reader's feelings of pity, sorrow, or compassion for a character.

### Paragraph X
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Defoe makes a fine philosophical commentary here on the nature of death, as he refers to the pit as "the common grave of mankind" where both "poor and rich went together."

### Paragraph XII - end
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Defoe's descriptions here of the sights and sounds of plague-infested London are truly terrifying. Again, *first person narrative* point-of-view is essential to the effectiveness of this passage. Relating the incident of the man who leaped into the Thames<a href="#note3" id="note3ref"><sup>3</sup></a> in the final paragraph of the excerpt further streghtens the impression that this story is being related to us by someone who was actually present.



### Vocab
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a id="note1" href="#note1ref"><sup>1</sup></a> A sexton is a person who looks after a church and churchyard, sometimes acting as bell-ringer and formerly as a gravedigger.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a id="note2" href="#note2ref"><sup>2</sup></a> Pathos is a quality that evokes pity or sadness.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a id="note3" href="#note3ref"><sup>3</sup></a> The River Thames is a river that flows through southern England including London. At 215 miles, it is the longest river entirely in England and the second longest in the United Kingdom, after the River Severn. It flows through Oxford, Reading, Henley-on-Thames and Windsor.
