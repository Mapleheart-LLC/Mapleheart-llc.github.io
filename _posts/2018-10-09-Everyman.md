&quot;Everyman&quot; is a **morality** play - as such, it must have a moral message

The character of Everyman represents all humanity

**Messenger** - introduces us to the play - we are told it will be a moral lesson

**God** - speaks about the destiny of all men -  they must give a reckoning of their lives - man is sinful and must go before God.

**Death** - his job is to go to Everyman and tell him of the pilgrimage that he must make - nobody is exempt - and death is never expected.

Everyman, when informed of his pilgrimage, begins to call on his &quot;friends&quot; from his life to accompany him on his journey -

  **Fellowship** - represents friends - they, however, cannot help you when you go before God

  **Kindred/Cousin** - relations/family - they are a bit more agreeable, but cannot go either.

  **Goods** - all your worldly possessions - will not/cannot go either - they are worthless

  **Good Deeds** - your good works - few and far between! - bound &quot;under the ground&quot; - buried too deeply under the weight of sin to do Everyman any good - they can&#39;t go - _yet_.
>    **Knowledge** - represents the knowledge and acceptance of one&#39;s sins - **She can go!**

Knowledge accompanies Everyman to **confession** - this personification of **auricular confession** - the first  of four parts of the sacrament of **penance** (shrift)

  **Contrition** (true sorrow for one&#39;s sins)

  **Absolution**

**Satisfaction**

Following his confession, **penance** , and absolution, Everyman&#39;s **Good Deeds** are freed from the ground - Good Deeds can now accompany Everyman along with **Discretion** , **strength** ,   **beauty** , and **five wits**

At the grave, one by one, discretion, strength, beauty, and five wits all leave  Everyman, but Good Deeds remains
