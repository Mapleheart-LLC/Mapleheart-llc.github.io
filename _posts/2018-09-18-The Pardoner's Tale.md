&quot;The Pardoner&#39;s Tale is an **exemplum** , or parable, of a text taken from St. Paul&#39;s &quot;Epistle to Timothy&quot; (6:10) which says, _Radix malorum est  cupiditas_ - the root of evil is desire, or, the more familiar &quot;Money is the root of all evil&quot;

II. 58-60 - **setting** - the tale opens in a tavern - the three central characters are  rioters who partake of the tavern&#39;s sins.

I. 70 - the man &quot;slain&quot; by Death was excessively drunk - hints here that his Death is probably his own fault.

I. 72 - **personification** - Death is personified as a thief who steals life

I. 78 - Death is treated as if were a practical and physical, not a spiritual problem

II. 89  ff. - the rioters curse throughout the tale - they take God&#39;s name in vain through common medieval oaths in which God is personified, then &quot;dismembered&quot;

II. 95-96 - **irony** - they vow to kill Death and to live and die for each other

II. 100-101 - again, **ironic,** because while the rioters swear to die for one another, they will actually kill each other because cupidity (greed) is the root of all evil

I. 106 - Since the body was considered to be holy, these are particularly evil oaths.

I. 114-116 - they are disrespectful to the old man.

II. 125-137 - extended **imagery** is something of an allusion to the story of Oedipus, blindly wandering through wold in Sophocles&#39;s _Oedipus at Colonus_

II. 114-145 - **symbol** - the old man preaches to them to do unto others as they would have others do unto them - some scholars suggest that he represents wisdom and virtue

I. 149 - again, disrespectful of the old man - plus, the rioter swears &quot;by God&quot; as well - **foreshadowing** that bad things will happen soon.

II. 154 -158 - **characterization** - the rioters misinterpret everything; they assume the old man is a spy for Death - they look everywhere but within themselves to find clues to the truth

II. 167-169 - the old man sends the rioters to a tree in search of Death - they find gold and the gold reveals their **greed** - greed leads to Death.

I. 171 - the rioters forget Death when they see the gold, unaware that gold can lead to death - they see only the surface of things not the underlying spiritual truths.

I 178 - &quot;It&#39;s clear that Fortune... this treasure...&quot; - this philosopher Boethius argued that good fortune is always bad because it makes one trust in worldly things and forget God.

ll. 167-169 –  the old man sends the rioters to a tree in search of death – they find gold
  and the gold reveals their greed – greed leads to Death.

l. 171 –  the rioters forget Death when they see the gold, unaware that gold can lead to
death – they see only the surface of things, not the underlying spiritual truths.

l. 178 –  &quot;It&#39;s clear that Fortune…this treasure…&quot; –  the philosopher Boethius argued  that good fortune is always bad because it makes one trust in worldly things and forget God.

ll. 181-182 –  irony –  good fortune will lead to Death – the moral of the tale is Radix

                malorum est cupiditas – The root of evil is desire

l. 207 –  the rioter&#39;s speaking of &quot;trust&quot; is especially ironic

ll. 223-230 –  greed manifests itself as one rioter suggests murder of another.

l. 231 –  irony –  the rioter says one thing but means quite the opposite!

ll. 243-245 –  in Medieval theology, if a person closes his heart to charity, the Devil is free to tempt one to sin.

ll. 250-251 –  irony –  the young rioter is unaware of the plot against him.

l. 277 –  metaphor –  man is often described as &quot;clay&quot; in Medieval literature.

l. 280 –  the Pardoner probably asks these two rhetorical questions because the outcome is inevitable, as it was from the beginning – death can only be slain in a spiritual sense.

l. 285 –  irony –  there will be more than one corpse to bury all to soon!

ll. 294-295 –  their desires have destroyed the rioters – the point is not merely that they died, but that they died because they placed all their faith in wealth and trickery.

ll. 299-end –  the Pardoner ends his tale with some truly impressive and quite shame- less self-promotion!  He encourages any and all (but, particularly those with the most sin) to come forward, kiss his religious relics, and, most importantly, to unbuckle your purse! and purchase a pardon.
