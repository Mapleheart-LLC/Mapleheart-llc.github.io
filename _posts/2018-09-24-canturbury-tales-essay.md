<center><h1>“The Franklin’s Tale” </h1></center>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The Franklin’s Tale” is about a wife whose husband leaves to gain honor in England. The wife gets worried about the rocks on the coast preventing his return. She then goes to a young fellow, who’s in love with her and gets him to clear the shore up in return for her body. The fellow gets a mage to make the rocks vanish, and the husband comes back and tells his wife that she must keep her word. The fellow is impressed and all debt is voided.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This tale is a short romance, one of the more successful ones as well. Although the entire tale is more about being truthful and keeping to your word. You don’t always know how the promise is going to turn out. Nor do you if go against the your word. When the wife promises that the young fellow can have sexual relations with her in return for clearing the rocks. She actually is almost forced to go through with it by her husband, just because she made that promise. The young fellow knew and respected that her husband was going to make sure that she kept her word. So the fellow decided that for being such a good sport, he wouldn’t take due, going to prove that keeping your word is a thing that should be done.
