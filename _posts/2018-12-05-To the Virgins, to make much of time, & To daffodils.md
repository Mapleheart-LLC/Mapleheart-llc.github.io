As was the case with most of the Cavalier poets, Herrick's poetry reflects the ***carpe diem*** tradition - as well as the idea that time (and the end of a way of life) is rapidly closing in on them!

## "To the Virgins, to Make Much of Time"

```
Gather ye rosebuds while ye may,
   Old Time is still a-flying;
And this same flower that smiles today
   Tomorrow will be dying.

The glorious lamp of heaven, the sun, 
   The higher he’s a-getting,
The sooner will his race be run,
   And nearer he’s to setting.

That age is best which is the first,
   When youth and blood are warmer;
But being spent, the worse, and worst
   Times still succeed the former. 

Then be not coy, but use your time,
   And while ye may, go marry;
For having lost but once your prime,
   You may forever tarry.
```

II 1-4 - *tone* - the first stanza, like the rest of the poem, conbines a light graceful tone with a serious message.

I 2 - time, like in Marvell's *"Coy Mistress"* is chasing us!

II 3-4 - *metaphor* - "flower" here refers to youth/virginity

II 5-8 *metaphor* - life is here compared to the course of the sun - a familiar image

I 9 - youth is the time to enjoy love - use it up now,  ``` because it will never be this good ```

II 13-14 - don't play hard to get - enjoy now! - and happily

I 15 - otherwise, you may end up in lonely old age!

## "To Daffodils"

```
FAIR daffodils, we weep to see	 
  You haste away so soon;	 
As yet the early-rising sun	 
  Has not attain'd his noon.	 
        Stay, stay	         5
    Until the hasting day	 
        Has run	 
    But to the evensong;	 
And, having pray'd together, we	 
    Will go with you along.	  10
 
We have short time to stay, as you,	 
  We have as short a spring;	 
As quick a growth to meet decay,	 
  As you, or anything.	 
        We die	  15
    As your hours do, and dry	 
        Away	 
    Like to the summer's rain;	 
Or as the pearls of morning's dew,	 
    Ne'er to be found again.	  20
```

This poem is an excellent example of the ***extended metaphor***.

I 1 - the poet ponders the *brevity* of life - mourning the short life of the flowers

II 2-10 - the basic idea here is that life passes before we are aware

II 11-14 - the poet compares the short life of flowers to that of human beings

II 15-20 - *simile* - the poet compares the short life of humans to summer's rains and morning's dew
