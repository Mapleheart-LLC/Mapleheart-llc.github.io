As some fond virgin, whom her mother’s care
Drags from the town to wholesome country air,
Just when she learns to roll a melting eye,
And hear a spark, yet think no danger nigh;
From the dear man unwillingly she must sever,
Yet takes one kiss before she parts forever:
Thus from the world fair Zephalinda ﬂew,
Saw others happy, and with sighs withdrew;
Not that their pleasures caused her discontent;
She sighed not that they stayed, but that She went.
She went, to plain-work, and to purling brooks,
Old-fashioned halls, dull aunts, and croaking rooks,
She went from opera, park, assembly, play,
To morning walks, and prayers three hours a day;
To part her time ’twixt reading and bohea,
To muse, and spill her solitary tea,
Or o’er cold coffee triﬂe with the spoon,
Count the slow clock, and dine exact at noon;
Divert her eyes with pictures in the ﬁre,
Hum half a tune, tell stories to the squire;
Up to her godly garret after seven,
There starve and pray, for that’s the way to heaven.
Some squire, perhaps, you take a delight to rack;
Whose game is whisk, whose treat a toast in sack;
Who visits with a gun, presents you birds,
Then gives a smacking buss, and cries — No words!
Or with his hound comes hollowing from the stable,
Makes love with nods, and knees beneath a table;
Whose laughs are hearty, though his jests are coarse,
And loves you best of all things — but his horse.
In some fair evening, on your elbow laid,
You dream of triumphs in the rural shade;
In pensive thought recall the fancied scene,
See coronations rise on every green;
Before you pass the imaginary sights
Of lords and earls and dukes and gartered knights;
While the spread fan o’ershades your closing eyes;
Then give one ﬂirt, and all the vision ﬂies.
Thus vanish sceptres, coronets, and balls,
And leave you in lone woods, or empty walls.
So when your slave, at some dear, idle time
(Not plagued with headaches, or the want of rhyme)
Stands in the streets, abstracted from the crew,
And while he seems to study, thinks of you:
Just when his fancy points your sprightly eyes,
Or sees the blush of soft Parthenia rise,
Gay pats my shoulder, and you vanish quite;
Streets, chairs, and coxcombs rush upon my sight;
Vexed to be still in town, I knit my brow,
Look sour, and hum a tune — as you may now.

## Background
 Pope's poem is called an **epistle** - a formal literary letter addressed to a specific person, but intended for a wide audience - unlike an informal letter, the epistle is a conciously public or literary effort rather than a spontaneous, private communication - Pope considered the epistle a formal letter in verse used for the purpose of satirizing society.

## Notes
II 1-2 - **diction** - her mother "drags" Miss Blount home to the country - suggests that she doesn't really want to return.  
II 2-3 - Miss Blount is an "innocent" - she is too young to realise that the rogue's "flirtatious" remark - it's all just harmless fun to her.  
I - "...Thus from the world fair Zephalinda (Miss Blount) flew..." - suggests that, in the country, Miss Blount is protected from the *real* world.  
I 10 - again, re-emphasises that she would much rather have stayed there!
II 11-20 - **contrats** the kind of world in which Miss Blount exists with the one she left behind.  
II 15-18 - **tone** - suggests that, in her world, the days just drag by - "...count the slow clock..." also, "...and dine exact at noon..." suggests there's little variation in her dull routine.  
II 21-22 - **tone**  - Pope takes a satirical jab at the puritanical religious practices of the country gentry.  
II 23-30 - in contrast to the suave and debonair gentlemen she met in [London](https://www.google.com/maps/place/London,+UK/@51.5287718,-0.24168,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x47d8a00baf21de75:0x52963a5addd52a99!8m2!3d51.5073509!4d-0.1277583), Miss Blount, unhappily, is stuck with the inept and bumbling country squire, a doofus who is more enamored of his horse!  
II 31-40 - Miss Blount, in moments of solitude (and there a lot of them!) longingly recollects her experiences in the city.  
II 40-end - Pope speaks with fondness of Miss Blount for most of this last section, referring to himself as her "slave."  
I 47 - Pope's thoughts, however, are just as easily distracted from Miss Blount by a tap on the shoulder - the *irony* here is in the contrast in how the speaker views the world of the city with how Miss Blount views it - "...Gay pats my shoulder and you vanish quite..." - for him, it was just another London weekend.
