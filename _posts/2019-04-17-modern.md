With the dawn of the 20<sup>th</sup> century came, at last, the massive social and political upheaval that the Victorians foresaw in the latter stages of the 19<sup>th</sup> century. The changes brought upon England by the Industrial Revolution, advances in science and technology, and the increasing number of poor had overwhelming effects on Britain and her people - effects that would influence the country well into the present!  

Without question, the most influential and far-reaching event of the early 20<sup>th</sup> century was the First World War. 


## World War I - "**The Great War**"

The first modern war - ushered in the use of new "weapons of mass destruction"  
  - The Tank
  - The Submarine
  - Barbed Wire
  - The Machine Gun
  - The Aeroplane
  - Chemical Gas (Mustard gas, Tear gas, and others <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_weapons_in_World_War_I">[1]</a> </sup>)

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8 Million soldiers died - many in hand-to-hand combat - the devastation and waste inflicted on Europe was unlike anything had witnessed in the history of war - many small towns and villages in England had entire male populations entirely wiped out - rat infested, disease ravaged, corpse filled trenches, ppoison gas, and violent, senseless death and destruction permanently destroyed, for all time, the notion of war as glorious. The feeling that natural order of things - the very fabric of the world itself - had been hopelessly thrown into choas, had become unraveled, no longer made rational sense - this feeling would affect the literature of England (and America) well into the 20<sup>th</sup> century.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first World War gave rise to a fine group of soldier-poets whoose work helped to powerfully express the true horrors of war and its aftermath.
- Siegfried Sassoon (1886 - 1967)
- Wilfred Owen (1893 - 1918)
- Robert Graves (1895 - 1985)
- Rupert Brooke (1887 - 1915) (although Brooke is frequently grouped with these poets, he never saw combat) 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From this point on, many of the younger writers of the period turned in disgust from public affairs - whatever was associated with the "old order" was condemned because it was that old order which had produced this horrible war - the result was a move away from traditional pre-war froms in favour of new directions in literature.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Virginia Woolf (1882 - 1941), E.M. Foster (1879-1970), James Joyce (1882 - 1942), and D.H. Lawrence (1885 - 1930)** all were writers associated with a new **Modernism**, emphasizing the exploration of the psychological depth of characters and technical experimentation in stories and, especially, poetry.  
The work of **T.S. Eliot (1888 - 1965)** was a major influence of this period - his famous poem, "*The Wasteland*" (1922) was one of the finest examples of the new literary Modernism.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rise of **fascism** was of significant influence to writers of the early 20<sup>th</sup> - the punitive nature of the Versailles Treaty sowed the seeds that would eventually give rise Nazi Germany - meanwhile, the Bolshevik Revolution brought about the emergance of the Soviet Union and the spread of socialism to countries like Italy and Spain - the **Spanish Civil War** was a diverse event that drew the presence (and in some cases, participation) of many noted young writers - **W.H. Auden, Stephen Spender, George Orwell,** and Americans like **Ernest Hemingway** and **Langston Hughes**.
