**Notes – from Le Morte D’Arthur (The Siege of Benwick, The Day of Destiny)**

**- Sir Thomas Malory**

These two passages from our new text are the final two sections of <span class="underline">Le Morte D’Arthur</span>. From them, we learn more about the importance of the Code of Chivalry as well as the actual death of King Arthur and the return of the Sword of Kings, **<span class="underline">Excalibur</span>**, to the Lady of The Lake.

“The Siege of Benwick”

ll. 4-6 – **conflict** – Arthur and Launcelot’s battle stems from the affair between Launcelot and Gwynevere, Arthur’s wife and queen.

ll. 14-23 – Launcelot refuses to go out and confront Arthur’s forces because, according to the Code of Chivalry, he still owes allegiance to Arthur.

ll. 52-54 – again, the Code – out of respect, Launcelot must wait until Arthur actually endangers the city before he can honorably engage him.

ll. 97-100 – strength influenced by some enchantment or magical spell is a common theme in the Medieval romance.

ll. 123-125 – **plot** – that Gawain would still return to challenge Launcelot again, despite being so severely injured the first time, is a measure of his desire for revenge – remember that Launcelot killed two of Gawain’s brothers in his rescue of the imprisoned Gwynevere.

ll. 147-148 – Launcelot’s refusal to kill Gawain when he has fallen is another example of the Code – it would be dishonorable.

**“The Day of Destiny”**

II. 161-165 - Gwynevere’s actions illustrate the Chivalric Code in that, despite Mordred’s overtures, she remains loyal to Arthur.

II. 169-180 - **theme** - the conflict between Mordred and the Archbishop of Canterbury is one that will be revisited often in history - the frequent conflict between **<span class="underline">worldly</span>** power and **<span class="underline">religious</span>** power - the Church and the Crown were often at odds\!

II. 210-239 - Gawain’s dying requests in the letter to Sir Launcelot illustrate his **<span class="underline">nobility</span>** - he has admitted that he was “moved by the spirit of revenge and spite” and that his selfishness has weakened Arthur’s kingdom.

II. 338-359 - there may be some religious significance to Bedivere’s needing *<span class="underline">three</span>* trips before he is able to return Excalibur to the Lady of the Lake - the number three figures prominently in Biblical stories such as the temptation of Christ and Simon Peter’s betrayal of Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane.

I. 373 - “Avalon” parallels other places in myth and legend such as Valhalla in Scandinavian myth and Elysium Fields in Greek myth.

II. 406-407 - as with many legends, the Latin phrase at the end of the story suggests that the hero will one day return.
