**<span class="underline">Renaissance</span>** means “rebirth” - in this case, the rebirth of the intellectual and artistic energies that characterised ancient Greek and Roman civilization.

The Renaissance had its origins in **<span class="underline">Italy</span>** in the fourteenth century, primarily in the work of the following important figures:

  - > Petrarch (1304 - 1374) and Boccaccio (1313 - 1375) in literature

  - > Giotto (1266? - 1337?) in painting

  - > Brunelleschi (1377? - 1446) in architecture

  - > Donatello (1386 - 1466) in sculpture

> **<span class="underline">Renaissance Humanism</span>** - movement lead by **Lorenzo de’ Medici**, which emphasised the capacities of the human mind and the achievements of human culture - this differed from the Medieval emphasis on God.
> 
> Both **<span class="underline">Leonardo da Vinci</span>** and **<span class="underline">Michelangelo</span>** began their careers during this era - the visual arts flourished as never before\!

The Renaissance fervor spread to other European countries, making it to England last of all - this was a time of great exploration and discovery -

Columbus discovered the Americas in **1492**

**<span class="underline">England</span>** was slow to participate in the European Renaissance due, primarily to internal turmoil and instability - consider the following factors:

  - > **The Wars of the Roses** (1455-1485)

  - > The invention of **<span class="underline">moveable type</span>** - a significant Renaissance invention which had only recently reached England.

With the crowning of **<span class="underline">Henry VII</span>** and later, his son **<span class="underline">Henry VIII</span>**, the **<span class="underline">Tudor</span>** line was established, bring stability to the throne and the country.

Under King Henry VIII, the Renaissance ***really*** began in England with the work of **<span class="underline">Sir Thomas More, Sir Thomas Wyatt,</span>** and **<span class="underline">Henry Howard.</span>**

The **<span class="underline">Protestant Reformation</span>** was born in 1517, when **<span class="underline">Martin Luther</span>** nailed his Ninety-five Theses to the church door at Wittenberg, Germany.

The Pope’s refusal to grant Henry VIII’s request for a divorce from Catherine of Aragon further fueled the protestant reform movement as Henry gave birth to the **<span class="underline">Anglican Church</span>** (the Church of England) in defiance of Rome.

Further turmoil was fueled when Henry’ particularly the half Spanish **<span class="underline">Mary</span> and her husband <span class="underline">Philip II of Spain</span>** (devout Catholics) instituted a “reign of terror” against English protestants - the queen was known as **<span class="underline">Bloody Mary</span>**.

Upon Mary’s death after only 5 years on the throne, **<span class="underline">Elizabeth</span>**, her half sister and Henry VIII’s daughter by Anne Boleyn, became queen.

Elizabeth I is considered to be one of England’s greatest monarchs - under her leadership, England became a world power\!

  - > She encouraged literary and artistic development

  - > She moderated the internal tension between Protestants and Catholics

  - > She encouraged British exploration of the New World

  - > She encouraged the increase in British revenues through raids on Spanish shipping - Spain was England’s major foreign enemy.

  - > Her authority was culminated in the defeat of the **<span class="underline">Spanish Armada</span>** by the British navy in 1588.
