The films that have been made as a result of people reading Mary Shelly's novel all vary in the level of craftsmanship and their ability to stay true to the original work. Throughout the years, starting in 1914, films have been created in order to tell this story. The growing popularity of the monster brought the then budding Hollywood into a festive mood. 

The first *Frankenstein *movie watched was from 1910 entitled *Frankenstein*. It's about twelve minutes long and is a silent film, meaning that while there is no voices or lines, there is music. The film while it has the characters of the novel doesn't actually follow the story all that well. It seems to be staged more for shock value than the actual story - which makes sense. The entire movie is set to quick pacing and manages to hold said pacing well. While the entire film might be horrendously off the actual plot-line of the novel, it is still amusing to watch. Which means that it can be considered to be a job well done. 

The novel its self is a pristine example of a timeless story. One of the first science-fiction books written.  Shelley was able to write a book which was about a man who instead of growing insane, as most stories go, the man instead became sane again. Frankenstein, the man, was most clearly deep into insanity within the first few chapters of the novel even beginning. Slowly becoming sane again as he finishes up his science experiment of reanimating his former mentor. Within hours after finally doing so, Frankenstein has instant regret towards the deed.  So he abandons the monster to the wild and hopes he doesn't encounter it again.  Random and chance encounters pop up all throughout the novel, Shelly uses the changing point of view combined with these encounters to drive the story unto the finishing line.
