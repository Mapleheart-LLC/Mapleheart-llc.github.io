The term “metaphysical poets” was coined by **Samuel Johnson**, the famous 18<sup>th</sup> century critic – **<span class="underline">metaphysics</span>** – speculations on the basic principles governing the

realms of knowledge and being – according to Johnson, metaphysical poets were

fond of displaying obscure and specialized learning in their poems.

<span class="underline">Basic Characteristics</span>

\- metaphysical poets wrote both love poems and religious or meditative lyrics

\- they make extensive use of **<span class="underline">paradox</span>** – an apparent contradiction which turns out on

close inspection to yield a valuable perception.

\- their poems tend to be written in lines of unequal or varying length and in rhythms

that reflect the irregular and unpredictable movements of an active mind and of an

informal speaking voice.

\- they tend to apply religious images and ideas to human love, and, vice versa – the

application of language normally associated with human love to religious experience.

\- metaphysical poets show an intense spirituality as well as a concern for individual

moral responsibility.

### "The Jacobean Age"

Named for Queen Elizabeth's successor, James Stuart (James I), her cousin and king of Scotland - his reign (1603-1625) is known as the "Jacobean Era" - this comes from ***Jacobaeus***, the Latin form of the name *James*.

Donne's holy sonnets, or _Devine Meditations_, were composed between 1609 and 1611, before Donne was ordained as an Anglican minister. The sonnets are in the Italian form, with a clear shift at the volta, or turn, after the eighth line, and a marked change of tone in the sestet. The change may be from a passionate, dramatic opening to a quiet, meditative closing (as in no. 7 below) - though sometimes, as in "Holy Sonnet 14," the end of the poem is even more flamboyant than the beginnning.

    At the round earth's imagin'd corners, blow 
    Your trumpets, angels, and arise, arise 
    From death, you numberless infinities 
    Of souls, and to your scatter'd bodies go; 
    All whom the flood did, and fire shall o'erthrow, 
    All whom war, dearth, age, agues, tyrannies, 
    Despair, law, chance hath slain, and you whose eyes 
    Shall behold God and never taste death's woe. 
    But let them sleep, Lord, and me mourn a space, 
    For if above all these my sins abound, 
    'Tis late to ask abundance of thy grace 
    When we are there; here on this lowly ground 
    Teach me how to repent; for that's as good 
    As if thou'hadst seal'd my pardon with thy blood. 

In "Holy Sonnet 4," make note, particularly, of the contrast between the eneergy of the ___octave___ and the calmer mood of the ***sestet*** - the speaker, as if frightened by the energy he released in the octave, asks God to help him repent now, in this life, rather than wait to guarentee his salvation in the future.

## Holy Sonnet VII

II 1-4 - **imagery** - the Biblical imagery here (trumpets, angels, souls) lends a solemn, ethereal **tone**. 

II 2-4 **diction** - in slow, measured pace, the poet addresses not only angels but all of humanity, past, present, and future, from the time of the flood to the firery apocalypse that will user in the Day of Judgement.

II 5-8 - the pace of these lines quickens as the poet, in short order, catalogs the miseries endured by humankind.

II 9-14 - in the **sestet**, a shift in *tone* as the poet turns to a rayerful communion with God - with the bision of the Last Judgement still vividly before him, he asks, with the help of God's grace, for the ability to repent and for salvation.
