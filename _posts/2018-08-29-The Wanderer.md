As we have discussed before, the famous &quot;Exeter Book&quot; contains the largest collection of Anglo-Saxon verse to have survived. In addition to the riddles which we will read, the volume contains many fine examples of a poetic element common to this era - the **ubi sunt** motif.&quot;Ubi sunt&quot; literally means &quot;where are,&quot; and is taken from the Latin phrase _ubi sunt qui ante nos fuerunt_, meaning &quot;where are those who were before us?&quot; The _ubi sunt_ motif is a meditation on mortality and life&#39;s transience. &quot;The Wanderer&quot; most exemplifies _ubi sunt_ poetry in its use of the **rhetorical question** (ie. &quot;where has the horse gone, where the young warrior, where is the giver of treasure?&quot;) The _ubi sunt_ motif is a common element of the **elegiac** poem.

II 1-7 - there is a narrator, who introduces the traveler in these lines, and then steps away so that the &quot;wanderer&quot; may speak.

II. 5-6 metaphor - memory is described as a &quot;single port,&quot; establishing early on the seafaring imagery common to most Anglo-Saxon verse. Note also the mention of **fate** - remnant of the old pagan tradition.

II 8-22 - **tone** - these lines are very typical of the feeling of isolation that dominates much Anglo-Saxon verse - generally, the isolation is both physical and emotional.

II. 26-35 - these lines seem to suggest that the era of the mead hall and of the fellowship of shared experiences has come to an end.

II 40-54 - **contrast** - here, between the life of the speaker&#39;s past, and the lonely existence of his present.

II 55-62 - here begins the speaker&#39;s commentary on the brevity of earthly existence - and the fonality of it! Fate figures prominently in these lines as well.
