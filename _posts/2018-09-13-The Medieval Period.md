**<span class="underline">Norman</span>** is derived from “North Men” - the Normans were descendants of the Vikings who had seized northern France more than 100 years earlier - the area came to be known as **<span class="underline">Normandy</span>**

The Normans and the Anglo-Saxons were, over many years, blended together into what has become the national English character.

**<span class="underline">The Feudal System</span>**

A complicated system of land ownership which divided up the land among nobles, barons, lords, etc. - in reality, an elaborate system of loyalties.

In 1086, William published an inventory of all land holdings in the kingdom.

**<span class="underline">The Domesday Book</span>** (Doomsday Book)

England was, in the beginning, a predominantly agrarian society - over time, **<span class="underline">herding</span>** became predominant - as a result, England’s woolen industry was born - the increased production of wool eventually encouraged the growth of the cities.

Important during this era was the birth of **<span class="underline">common law</span>**, meaning law common to everyone, not just to certain classes - common law brought an end to the practice of **<span class="underline">ordeals</span>** - assigned people tasks to determine guilt or innocence

This was the era of the famous religious **<span class="underline">Crusades</span>**, which were military excursions into the Holy Land to attempt to free Jerusalem from Turkish control and to Christianize the Arabs - it didn’t work.

What *<span class="underline">was</span>* gained from these expeditions was valuable knowledge of Arabic culture, innovations in medicine and mathematics, and the birth of the **<span class="underline">Code of Chivalry</span>** - a code of rules for knightly behavior.

**<span class="underline">The Hundred Years War (1337-1453)</span>** - a series of wars fought to wrestle French possessions from the English monarchy - this war saw the development of the **<span class="underline">longbow</span>**, a weapon capable of piercing through armor\!

In truth, the longbow, the development of **<span class="underline">gunpowder</span>**, and the **<span class="underline">Black Plague</span>** all signaled the beginning of the end of the Medieval age.

**<span class="underline">The Wars of the Roses</span> (1455-1485)** - a civil war between the House of York (white rose) and the House of Lancaster (red rose) for the English throne - when Henry tudor defeated King Richard III and was crowned Henry VII, the Medieval period came to an end.
