title:  "The Lake Isle of Innisfree"
---
There are striking similarities to the Romantic style in this beautiful poem - one of Yeat's most popular. Note the poet's use of both *figurative language* and *sensory imagery* to capture teh beauty of a pastoral scene. The emotional responses which these images inspire in the speaker also recall the Romantic tradition.  

### The poem
<pre>
I WILL arise and go now, and go to Innisfree,	 
And a small cabin build there, of clay and wattles made;	 
Nine bean rows will I have there, a hive for the honey bee,	 
      And live alone in the bee-loud glade.	 
  
And I shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow,	         5
Dropping from the veils of the morning to where the cricket sings;	 
There midnight's all a glimmer, and noon a purple glow,	 
      And evening full of the linnet's wings.	 
  
I will arise and go now, for always night and day	 
I hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore;	  10
While I stand on the roadway, or on the pavements gray,	 
      I hear it in the deep heart's core.

### Notes
I 1 - note the capitalization of "WILL" - suggests that the poet is compelled to visit this place, whether i reality, or in his imagination.  
I 2 - "clay and wattles" - traditional items that were used in the building of small, rustic Irish dwellings - clay, of course, is earth - wattles are poles intertwined with twigs, weeds, or branches.  
I 4 - "...the bee-loud glade..." - wonderful descriptive phrase - worthy of Keats!  
II 5-8 - beautiful sensory *imagery*, appealing to both sight and sound - the "linnet" is the same bird we saw mentioned in Tennyson's "In Memoriam."  
I 10 - *alleration* - "...I hear **l**ake water **l**apping with **l**ow sounds..." - mimics the sound of water sofly moving along a shore line.  
II 11-12 - these final lines echo Wordsworth's sentiment when viewing the Wie valley in "Tinturn Abbey" - like Wordsworth, Yeats "hears" the sounds of the Lake Isle in his imagination ("the deep heart's core") - when "on the roadway, or on pavements grey" these thoughts bring him peace - ***very romantic*** Romantic!
