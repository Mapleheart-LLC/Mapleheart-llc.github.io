English, like most languages, can trace its origins back to **<span class="underline">Indo-European</span>**, spoken by a group of tribes that lived in Europe or western Asia.

By **4000 BC**, this group broke up into several sections

One group migrated to **<span class="underline">India</span>**

Several other groups migrated to **<span class="underline">Asia Minor</span>**, **<span class="underline">Greece</span>**, **<span class="underline">Italy</span>**, and northern and western **<span class="underline">Europe</span>**.

The various branches evolved over time into a large number of different languages:

  -  **Sanskrit**

  -  **Greek**

  -  **Latin**
    
      -  **Italian**
    
      -  **French**
    
      -  **Spanish**

  -  **Germanic**
    
      -  **German**
    
      -  **Dutch**
    
      -  **Swedish**
    
      -  **English**

> English is largely **<span class="underline">Germanic</span>** in origin, due largely to the influence of the three Germanic tribes that invaded Britain in the 5<sup>th</sup> century.

> **JUTES  
> ANGLES**

> **SAXONS**

 The Germanic alphabet consisted of **<span class="underline">runes</span>** - the runic alphabet was used for carving inscriptions on wood and stone - there was no written language

  -  Most knowledge of **<span class="underline">Old English</span>** is based on manuscripts written by monks.

A number of our present day words are virtually unchanged from the Old English, most common being our **<span class="underline">prepositions</span>** like under, to, for, from, and **<span class="underline">connectives</span>** like that, and, where, or - also most of our **<span class="underline">pronouns</span>** like his, I, we, and your - grammar has also remained fundamentally unchanged - **<span class="underline">verbs</span>** still retain the same tenses - subjects precede verbs and prepositions precede their objects just as they did in Old English - contributions by other languages have been largely to our **<span class="underline">Vocabulary</span>**\!

During the Anglo-Saxon period, three other languages made significant contributions to the English vocabulary:

**<span class="underline">Celtic</span>** languages, in place at the time of the Roman invasion, contributed many place names such as Kent, York, Thames, Dover, and Avon

Dyfed, Powys, and Clwyd (Welsh counties) Llewelyn.

**<span class="underline">Latin</span>** contributed many Christian terms to the language like alter, disciple, mass, nun, and shrine - also education terms such as school, Verse, paper, and title and everyday words like plant, mat, and box

**<span class="underline">Old Norse</span>**, the language of the Danish invaders who settled in northern England, contributed many place names - towns like Whitby, Thornby, Kirkby, Grimsby, and Willoughby owe their “by” endings to the Old Norse “Byr” (Town) - the Danes contributed many everyday terms like add, fellow, guess, kindle, leg, loose, lug, nag, raise, sky, and window.
