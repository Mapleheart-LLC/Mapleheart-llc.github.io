In an era when critical writing and satire were extremely important, Joseph Addison
and Richard Steele stood at the forefront. Together, they invented a new style of
writing, as well as a new literary form. Their creation, the familiar periodical essay, was an entirely new form of writing, and their publications, “The Tatler” and “The Spectator,” were the forerunners of our modern day magazine.  

The familiar periodical essay was characterized by its brevity (shortness) and
discursive (rambling) style, covering a wide range of subjects. Addison and Steele’s
essays were designed to entertain and instruct the English middle class. These
essays introduced humor, (often, of course, in the form of satire) along with a less
formal diction. The English essayist William Hazlitt said of the essays of Addison and Steele that they were “more like the remarks which occur in sensible conversation and less like a lecture. Something is left to the imagination of the reader.”  

Both “The Tatler” and “The Spectator” were immensely popular. Popular magazines of
the era contained
- commentary on issues of the day
- political and world events of note
- social behavior and mores (such as matters of wardrobe and etiquette)
- light hearted gossip


Always, these essays were very urbane and sophisticated, geared toward the new,
rising middle class.


The ideal places for perusing Addison and Steele’s work were the coffee houses,
which eventually became a focal point of knowledge, social interaction, and education for the middle class, and both authors frequented them. “Will’s” was the meeting place for Addison and his group. “Button’s Coffeehouse” was even founded especially for Addison and his fellow Whigs! In his essays for The Tatler, Steele pretended to get reports of literature from “Will’s,” education from “The Grecian,” news from “The St. James,” and entertainment from “White’s Chocolate House.”
