title:  "The 'Byronic Hero' & 'She Walks in Beauty'"
date:   2019-04-09
excerpt: "The Byronic Hero is a type of character popularized by the works of Lord Byron, whose protagonists often embodied this archetype (though they did exist before him). This trope gained prominence during Romanticism. Sometimes an Anti-Hero, others an Anti-Villain, or even Just a Villain, Byronic heroes are charismatic characters with strong passions and ideals, but who are nonetheless deeply flawed individuals who may act in ways which are socially reprehensible because he's definitely contrary to his mainstream society."

The 'Byronic Hero' - one of the most prominent literary character types of the Romantic period - traits most closely associated with this character are as follows:  
- the Byronic Hero does **not** possess heroic virtue, but has many **dark** qualities.
- s/he is a "larger than life" character.
- s/he is usually isolated from society - a wanderer or is in exile of some kind.
- s/he is **moody** by nature or **passionate** about a particular issue - their emotional and intellectual capacties are superior to the average
- as a result, the Byronic hero is often arrogant, confident, abnormally sensitive, and extremely conscious of himself.
- s/he rejects the values and moral codes of society - because of this, he is often unrepentant by society's standards.
- often characterised by a guilty memory of some unnamed sexual crime.
- due to these characteristics, the Byronic hero is often a figure of repulsion as well as facination.

There is a pleasure in the pathless woods,
There is a rapture on the lonely shore,
There is society where none intrudes,
By the deep Sea, and music in its roar:
I love not Man the less, but Nature more,
From these our interviews, in which I steal
From all I may be, or have been before,
To mingle with the Universe, and feel
What I can ne’er express, yet cannot all conceal.

Roll on, thou deep and dark blue Ocean—roll!
Ten thousand fleets sweep over thee in vain;
Man marks the earth with ruin—his control
Stops with the shore;—upon the watery plain
The wrecks are all thy deed, nor doth remain
A shadow of man’s ravage, save his own,
When for a moment, like a drop of rain,
He sinks into thy depths with bubbling groan,
Without a grave, unknelled, uncoffined, and unknown.

His steps are not upon thy paths,—thy fields
Are not a spoil for him,—thou dost arise
And shake him from thee; the vile strength he wields
For earth’s destruction thou dost all despise,
Spurning him from thy bosom to the skies,
And send’st him, shivering in thy playful spray
And howling, to his gods, where haply lies
His petty hope in some near port or bay,
And dashest him again to earth:—there let him lay.

The armaments which thunderstrike the walls
Of rock-built cities, bidding nations quake,
And monarchs tremble in their capitals.
The oak leviathans, whose huge ribs make
Their clay creator the vain title take
Of lord of thee, and arbiter of war;
These are thy toys, and, as the snowy flake,
They melt into thy yeast of waves, which mar
Alike the Armada’s pride, or spoils of Trafalgar.

Thy shores are empires, changed in all save thee—
Assyria, Greece, Rome, Carthage, what are they?
Thy waters washed them power while they were free
And many a tyrant since: their shores obey
The stranger, slave, or savage; their decay
Has dried up realms to deserts: not so thou,
Unchangeable save to thy wild waves’ play—
Time writes no wrinkle on thine azure brow—
Such as creation’s dawn beheld, thou rollest now.

Thou glorious mirror, where the Almighty’s form
Glasses itself in tempests; in all time,
Calm or convulsed—in breeze, or gale, or storm,
Icing the pole, or in the torrid clime
Dark-heaving;—boundless, endless, and sublime—
The image of Eternity—the throne
Of the Invisible; even from out thy slime
The monsters of the deep are made; each zone
Obeys thee: thou goest forth, dread, fathomless, alone.

And I have loved thee, Ocean! and my joy
Of youthful sports was on thy breast to be
Borne like thy bubbles, onward: from a boy
I wantoned with thy breakers—they to me
Were a delight; and if the freshening sea
Made them a terror—’twas a pleasing fear,
For I was as it were a child of thee,
And trusted to thy billows far and near,
And laid my hand upon thy mane—as I do here.

<h2 align="right" ><a id="Childe_Harolds_Pilgrimage_Apostrophe_to_the_Ocean_0"></a>“Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage” (Apostrophe to the Ocean)</h2>
<p align="right" >This is the poem that made Byron the most famous poet in England. It consists of four cantos that were written over a period of six years. It is, primarily, a <strong>travelogue</strong> - the first two cantos, published in 1812, are based on Byron’s travels through Spain, Portugal, Albania, and Greece from 1809 to 1811. The poem follows the wanderings of Childe Harold (“childe” is a medieval term for a young nobleman awaiting knighthood), a melancholy, passionate, guilt-haunted, but proud outcast who, as a fictional projection of one aspect of Byron’s own personality, establishes the prototype for the “Byronic hero.” Canto III is considered to be the poem’s finest section, but Canto IV contains many fine moments, including our excerpt, Byron’s famous address to the ocean.</p>
