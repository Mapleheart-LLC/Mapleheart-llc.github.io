<h1 >"A Song for St. Cecilia's Day" </h1>
<h2> - John Dryden </h2>
</center>

<center><pre>
FROM harmony, from heavenly harmony,	 
      This universal frame began:	 
  When nature underneath a heap	 
      Of jarring atoms lay,	 
    And could not heave her head,	         5
The tuneful voice was heard from high,	 
    'Arise, ye more than dead!'	 
Then cold, and hot, and moist, and dry,	 
  In order to their stations leap,	 
     And Music's power obey.	  10
From harmony, from heavenly harmony,	 
   This universal frame began:	 
   From harmony to harmony	 
Through all the compass of the notes it ran,	 
The diapason closing full in Man.	  15
 
What passion cannot Music raise and quell?	 
    When Jubal struck the chorded shell,	 
  His listening brethren stood around,	 
    And, wondering, on their faces fell	 
  To worship that celestial sound:	  20
Less than a God they thought there could not dwell	 
    Within the hollow of that shell,	 
    That spoke so sweetly, and so well.	 
What passion cannot Music raise and quell?	 
 
    The trumpet's loud clangour	  25
      Excites us to arms,	 
    With shrill notes of anger,	 
      And mortal alarms.	 
  The double double double beat	 
      Of the thundering drum	  30
      Cries Hark! the foes come;	 
  Charge, charge, 'tis too late to retreat!	 
 
    The soft complaining flute,	 
    In dying notes, discovers	 
    The woes of hopeless lovers,	  35
Whose dirge is whisper'd by the warbling lute.	 
 
    Sharp violins proclaim	 
  Their jealous pangs and desperation,	 
  Fury, frantic indignation,	 
  Depth of pains, and height of passion,	  40
    For the fair, disdainful dame.	 
 
    But O, what art can teach,	 
    What human voice can reach,	 
      The sacred organ's praise?	 
    Notes inspiring holy love,	  45
  Notes that wing their heavenly ways	 
    To mend the choirs above.	 
 
  Orpheus could lead the savage race;	 
  And trees unrooted left their place,	 
    Sequacious of the lyre;	  50
But bright Cecilia rais'd the wonder higher:	 
When to her organ vocal breath was given,	 
  An angel heard, and straight appear'd	 
    Mistaking Earth for Heaven.	 
 
GRAND CHORUS.

As from the power of sacred lays	  55
  The spheres began to move,	 
And sung the great Creator's praise	 
  To all the Blest above;	 
So when the last and dreadful hour	 
This crumbling pageant shall devour,	  60
The trumpet shall be heard on high,	 
The dead shall live, the living die,	 
And Music shall untune the sky!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This poem helps us to usher in the *Neoclassical Period* in English literature - *neoclassicism* is the revival in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries of classical standards of **order, balance,** and **harmony** in literature. Neoclassical writers like Dryden and **Alexander Pope** developed a style that was characterised by good form, logic, symmetry, grace, good taste, restraint, clarity, and conciseness.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This poem is an ***ode*** - a poem, originally intended to be sung, whose stately, orante language is appropriate to its serious subject - it is a loft poem on a diginified theme.

### Stanza I
II 1-5 - the poet credits music with having helped to create life itself  
II 8-9 - the forces of creation and music share a common ancestry, according to the speaker.  
I 15 - the **diapason** is an organ stop - mankind represents nature;s fullest harmony.

### Stanza II  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, the poet emphasizes the beauty of music by relating the story of creation by Jubal, a decendant of Cain, and the wonder it inspired.

### Stanzas III-VI  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trumpet, flute, violin, and organ are each given individual attention here - the poet, like Edgar Allen Poe did in "The Bells," and Sidney Lanier in "The Song of the Chattahoochee," tries to alter the sound of each stanza to fit the instrument - in stanza VI, however, the organ recieves the highest praise.

### Grand Chorus  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this final "movement," Dryden imitates the sound of the final section of a great choral piece - rhythm and meter imitate the sound of a chorale, similar to Bach or Beethoven. The message of this section is that, much as it was at the beginning of the universe, music will be there when all things conme to an end!
