 **Notes – History of The Arthurian Legend**
 
 The legend of King Arthur exists largely in myth handed down from generation to
 
 generation for nearly 1500 years, but it also exists, at least to some degree, in actual history.
 
 King Arthur’s origins are **<span class="underline"Welsh</span** – the earliest mention of him can be found in an
 
 ancient book of poetry entitled ***The Black Book of Carmarthen***, named for the old
 
 Cornish town of Carmarthen in southern Wales – supposed birthplace of **Merlin**.
 
 There are numerous references to Arthur in this and another book entitled ***The Red***
 
 ***Book of Hergest*** (14<supth</sup century) which tells of Arthur’s famous victory over the
 
 Saxons at Mt. Badon – the work also makes mention of two of Arthur’s companions,
 
 **Cei** and **Bedwyr**, who would become **Kay** and **Bedivere.**
 
 In the Welsh **<span class="underline">triads</span>** or the Medieval collections of groupings of three that make up
 
 a major portion of Welsh literature and folklore, many references are made to Arthur,
 
 including his final battle, the ***Battle of Camlann***, where, in *The Annales Cambriae*
 
 (The Annals of Wales) it says, “…where Arthur and Medraut perished…”
 
 The famous Medieval cleric **<span class="underline">Geoffrey of Monmouth</span>** is the first great chronicler of
 
 the Arthurian legend – it is from Geoffrey that the character of **Merlin** receives its
 
 fullest development – according to Geoffrey, Arthur’s magical sword is known as
 
 **Caliburn**, possibly based on the famous Irish sword *Caladbolg* and was forged
 
 on the **<span class="underline">Isle of Avalon</span>**.
 
 The 9<sup>th</sup> century monk <span class="underline">**Nennius**</span>, in his ***Historia Brittorium***, places Arthur in a time
 
 period that can be verified and gives details of Arthur’s military career – he lists 12
 
 battles won by Arthur and gives their locations – Nennius reports that in the famous
 
 Battle of Mt. Badon, Arthur single-handedly killed 940 men\! He also says that Arthur
 
 went into one of his 12 great battles with the sign of the Virgin on his shield – we,
 
 of course, have learned that this was probably an attempt on the monk’s part to
 
 Christianize Arthur – Welsh tales, after all, were quite pagan\!
 
 Influenced by the work of Geoffrey of Monmouth, a French author named **Wace**
 
 wrote his own history of the English kings. His ***Roman de Brut*** gives us the first
 
 glimpse of **courtly love**, as well as the earliest reference to the **round table** and
 
 the naming of Arthur’s sword, **Excalibur**.
 
 These sources, along with Sir Thomas Malory’s famous ***Le Morte D’Arthur*** (1470)
 
 are the basis for the King Arthur legend as we know it today.
