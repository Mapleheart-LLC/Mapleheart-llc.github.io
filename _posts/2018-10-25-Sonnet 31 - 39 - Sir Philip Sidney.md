Sidney&#39;s sonnet sequence _Astrophel_ and _Stella_, from which these two selections are taken, was very influential in the work of other sonnet writers, particularly William Shakespeare. The sequence celebrates Sidney&#39;s love for Penelope Devereux, who ended up eventually marrying another. Most of the sonnets are written in the Petrarchan (Italian) form with minor variations, most often in the sestet.
