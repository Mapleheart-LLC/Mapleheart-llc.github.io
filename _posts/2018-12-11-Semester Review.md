## III. Literary Periods 
Thus far in British literature we have studied the Anglo-Saxon Period, the Medieval Period, the Renaissance, and the Enlightenment. Write a paragraph for each of these periods in which you describe the principles and ideals that governed the history and literature of that time. Select one literary work from each period (4 total) that you feel best exemplifies the period in which it was written. Explain why you chose that specific work.

A. THE ANGLO-SAXON PERIOD

B. THE MEDIEVAL PERIOD

C. THE RENAISSANCE.

### IV. COMMON THEMES Provide a complete explanation for these recurring themes.


A. unrequited love

* Unrequited love is the idea of loving someone/something and the loved object not loving you back. This first started coming to happen around the end of the Renaissance period.

B. courtly love

* Courtly love is a highly conventionalized medieval tradition of love between a knight and a married noblewoman. The love of the knight for his lady was regarded as an ennobling passion and the relationship was typically unconsummated. This was usually found to be in the Medieval time period.

C. carpe diem

* Carpe diem is the urging of someone to make the most of the present time and give little thought to the future or past. Most of the Cavaliers used this concept in their writings.

D. code of chivalry

* The code of chivalry was a moral system which went beyond rules of combat to protect the honour of the knights. This system was used in the Medieval era as well.

E. fate (wyrd)

* Wyrd is a verbal noun formed from the verb weorþan, meaning "to come to pass, to become." The concept of fate was heavily sewn into the cloth that was nordic society.

F. paganism vs. Christianity

* The conversion of Æthelberht, king of Kent is the first account of any Christian bretwalda conversion and is told by the Venerable Bede in his histories of the conversion of England. A famous case of a ruler adopting Christanity as well as keeping parts of his old faith was king Rædwald of East Anglia, who had a Christian altar erected within his pagan temple. His suspected burial place at Sutton Hoo shows definite influences of both Christian and pagan burial rites.

### V. ANALYSIS OF LITERARY SELECTIONS On the exam, you will have poems and excerpts from poems and other texts to analyze that we have not read. They were purposefully selected to test your interpretive, analy tical, and comprehension skills, as well as your knowledge of the various literary eras. In preparation, read the following texts and answer the questions for each.

The Anglo-Saxon Age

from "The Seafarer"

the Exeter Book

The only sound was the roaring sea, The freezing waves. The song of the swan Might serve for pleasure, the cry of the sea-fowl,

The death-noise of birds instead of laughter, The mewing of gulls instead of mead. Storms beat on the rocky cliffs and were echoed By icy-feathered terns and the eagle's screams; No kinsman could offer comfort there, To a soul left drowning in desolation.

I make this song   about me full sadly 
my own wayfaring.   I a woman tell 
what griefs I had   since I grew up 
new or old     never more than now. 
Ever I know     the dark of my exile.

First my lord went out    away from his people 
over the wave-tumult.    I grieved each dawn 
wondered where my lord     my first on earth might be.
Then I went forth    a friendless exile 
to seek service    in my sorrow's need. 
My man's kinsmen     began to plot 
by darkened thought    to divide us two 
so we most widely     in the world's kingdom 
lived wretchedly    and I suffered longing.

MY true-love hath my heart, and I have his,

I hold his dear, and mine he cannot miss,	
  There never was a better bargain driven:	
My true-love hath my heart, and I have his.	        5
 
His heart in me keeps him and me in one;	
  My heart in him his thoughts and senses guides:

I'll hate so perfectly that it shall be Treason to love that man that loves a she. Nay, I will hate the very good, I swear, That's in thy sex, because it doth lie there. Their very virtue, grace, discourse, and wit, And all for thee! What, wilt thou love me yet?

*Holy Sonnet XV*  
John Donne
```
WILT thou love God as He thee? then digest,	
My soul, this wholesome meditation,	
How God the Spirit, by angels waited on	
In heaven, doth make His temple in thy breast.	
The Father having begot a Son most blest,	        5
And still begetting—for he ne’er begun—	
Hath deign’d to choose thee by adoption,	
Co-heir to His glory, and Sabbath’s endless rest.	
And as a robb’d man, which by search doth find	
His stolen stuff sold, must lose or buy it again,	        10
The Sun of glory came down, and was slain,	
Us whom He had made, and Satan stole, 1 to unbind.	
’Twas much, that man was made like God before,	
But, that God should be made like man, much more.

*Fear No More the Heat o' the Sun*  
Shakespeare

```
Fear no more the heat o' the sun; 
Nor the furious winter's rages, 
Thou thy worldly task hast done, 
Home art gone, and ta'en thy wages; 
Golden lads and girls all must, 
As chimney sweepers come to dust.

Fear no more the frown of the great, 
Thou art past the tyrant's stroke: 
Care no more to clothe and eat; 
To thee the reed is as the oak: 
The sceptre, learning, physic, must 
All follow this, and come to dust.

Fear no more the lightning-flash, 
Nor the all-dread thunder-stone; 
Fear not slander, censure rash; 
Thou hast finished joy and moan; 
All lovers young, all lovers must
Consign to thee, and come to dust.

No exorciser harm thee! 
Nor no witchcraft charm thee! 
Ghost unlaid forbear thee! 
Nothing ill come near thee! 
Quiet consummation have; 
And renowned be thy grave!
